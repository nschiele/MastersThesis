    research study "Evaluating Bipartite Graph Visualizations"</h2>

    <h3>Study procedure</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 50px;">
        The actual study is divided into four parts. In each part, you will be
    presented with a network visualization of one type: bipartite, adjacency matrix or node-link.
      These visualizations do not contain any interactive elements. They are static.

      <br><br>

      The duration of the whole study is about 25 minutes. During the study,
    we will record the answer you provide to the question asked, the time it took,
    and your subjective response on how difficult you believed the task to be.
    The resulting data will be used for analysis.Before the study, you will be asked some demographics.
    The data provided will be kept potentially indefinitely. No personally identifying is collected.

    <h3>Data Recipients</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 50px;">
    The datasets collected during the study are available only in
    anonymous form that cannot be linked to a specific person. For each
    participant, we generate a random ID that we only disclose to the
    participant at the end of the study. If the participant retains this ID, he
    can use it to have his data deleted later on.
      <br><br>
    The data recorded is processed and evaluated statistically to be
    published in scientific journals or conference proceedings.
    Evaluated Research Data: Worldwide readers / users of scientific
    publications.
      <br><br>
    Raw Data within a repository: users that have been permitted to use the
    data within the university and the provider of the repository within the
    university. For reviewing processes for scientific publications, the raw
    data could be passed to the reviewers and the publisher.
      <br><br>
    The data above can potentially also be processed outside the EU in
    countries, where there are no comparable data protection laws. These
    can mean potential restrictions of your rights.
      <br><br>
    Based on policies the university archive must be consulted before
    deletion of data. The archive then decides on whether or not to keep
    the data.

    <h3>Duration of the Storage Period</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 50px;">
    All research data are stored till 10 years after the completion of a
    research project. Potentially, the concerned data will be transferred to
    the respective university archive, which can store it indefinitely.
    <h3>Your rights</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 50px;">
    No associations between data and the participant's identity are stored.
    Upon agreeing to take part in our study, each participant gets assigned
    a random identity, for the use in our study only. We are disclosing the
    random ID generated to the user at the end of the study. If the user
    retains this ID, he may use it at any point later on to have his data
    deleted. If the user loses the ID, it is no longer possible to link the data
    to the individual as no other personal data is stored.
    <br><br>
    Your participation in this study is voluntary. By giving your informed
    consent you are under no obligations. You may revoke your consent at
    any time without any legal consequences. You may abort the study at
    any time without giving reasons. Doing so will not result in any legal
    consequences for you.
    <br><br>
    You have the right to complain to the supervisory authority, should you
    be of the opinion that the processing of the personal data relating to you
    breaches legal regulations.
    <br><br>
    The competent supervisory authority is the State Data Protection and
    Freedom of Information Officer of Baden-Württemberg -
